# ![Gomoku](https://imatheussm.github.io/gomoku-front/assets/images/gomoku-logo.png)

A multiplayer, JavaScript-based implementation of gomoku. You can see this single-page application working by [clicking here](https://imatheussm.github.io/gomoku-front/). An implementation for the online multiplayer server can be found by [clicking here](https://github.com/imatheussm/gomoku-back).

This application was developed by the following authors:
- Eduardo Gil S. Cardoso ([@ygarasab](https://github.com/ygarasab));
- Gabriela S. Maximino ([@gabrielamaximino](https://github.com/gabrielamaximino)); and
- Igor Matheus S. Moreira ([@imatheussm](https://github.com/imatheussm)).

## Requirements

The gomoku front-end mainly relies on pure JavaScript to work. Third-party scripts include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to animate certain elements and [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to communicate with the multiplayer server, if applicable.
